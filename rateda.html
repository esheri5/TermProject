	<h2> Description </h2>
	<p>Games that are Rated AO have all the same explicit content as games <a href="ratedm.html" target="_blank">rated M</a>
		, but more of it and more intense variations of it. Rated AO<br> games are determined suitable for only ages 18+. They may include
		"prolonged scenes of intense violence, graphic sexual content, and gambling with real currency." Games Rated AO are as rare as they are
		because all of the major game console manufacturers (Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft) banned the release of any game with an AO rating. There are many
		games on the internet that have not been rated by the ESRB but would fall under this category. There are, however, some PC games that are rated AO.</p><br>

	<p style="font-weight: bold">
	An example of a game that was extreme enough to be given a rating of AO is Hatred. Hatred was given the rating AO due to it's
	violent content. Plenty of games that are <a href="ratedm.html" target="_blank">Rated M</a> have violence in them,
	but what made hatred stand out is it's theme. The main character controlled by the player is a man just fed up with society, and
	therefore decides he will kill everyone he sees. The player's only objective is to violently kill and destroy everyone and everything on the screen,
	which is literally simulating being a serial killer.
	On top of those factors, the game is extremely gory with dismemberment and decapitation.
